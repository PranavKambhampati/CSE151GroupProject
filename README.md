Our group is planning on doing a stock time series prediction. We plan on using historical data about specific stocks to predict how the stock-exchange and crypto-exchange market can fluctuate in the future. In addition, we will figure out the optimal time to buy and sell. 

These are the datasets we are currently planning on using:

S&P 500: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/henryhan117/sp-500-historical-data

NVIDIA: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/programmerrdai/nvidia-stock-historical-data

# Abstract (draft)

Our project aims to analyze historical data on stock prices through their time series to help people figure out the best time to buy and sell stocks. We will utilize datasets on the S&P 500 stock market index or stocks like NVIDIA to train predictive models through Python that strive to capture patterns in price movements. The dataset for the S&P 500 index contains data about environment score, social score, and governance score and highest level of controversy based on ESG. The dataset for the nvidia daily stock price data has data from 2004 to 2024 with the highest/lowest price during trading day, price at closing, and volume of shares during day. Our models will be able to successfully predict the best times to buy and sell by parsing through data and finding the trends. We hope to gain insights into how machine learning models can be used to predict trends in highly volataile markets and understand the potential of machine learning in a financial application.
