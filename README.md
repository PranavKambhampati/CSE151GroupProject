# CSE151GroupProject

Our CSE 151A group's members are:
- Pranav Kambhampati (pkambhampati@ucsd.edu)
- Abhijay Deevi (adeevi@ucsd.edu)
- Kevin Do (k8do@ucsd.edu)
- Ethan Cota
- Theodoros Hadjitofis (thadjitofis@ucsd.edu)
- Ragini Bomma (rbomma@ucsd.edu)

Our group is planning on doing a stock time series prediction. We plan on using historical data about specific stocks to predict how the stock-exchange and crypto-exchange market can fluctuate in the future. In addition, we will figure out the optimal time to buy and sell. 

These are the datasets we are currently planning on using:

Apple: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prathamjyotsingh/apple-stocks

S&P 500: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rikinzala/s-and-p-500-esg-and-stocks-data-2023-24

NVIDIA: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jvanark/nvidia-daily-stock-price-data

# Abstract (draft)

Our project aims to analyze historical data on stock prices through their time series to help people figure out the best time to buy and sell stocks (introduction). We will utilize datasets on stocks like NVIDIA or Apple to train predictive models through Python that strive to capture patterns in price movements (methods). Our models will be able to successfully predict the best times to buy and sell by parsing through data and finding the trends (results). We hope to gain insights into how machine learning models can be used to predict trends in highly volataile markets and understand the potential of machine learning in a financial application (discussion).

We can delete the things in parenthesis after it is finalized. its just there to show the different sections of the abstraction
