Our group is planning on doing a crypto and stock time series prediction. We plan on using historical data about specific stocks and cryptocurrencies to predict how the stock-exchange and crypto-exchange market can fluctuate in the future.

These are the datasets we are currently planning on using:
- [crypto-prices-download](https://github.com/martkir/crypto-prices-download)
- [Bitcoin BTC-USD stock dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gallo33henrique/bitcoin-btc-usd-stock-dataset/data)

# Abstract (draft)

Our project aims to analyze historical data on cryptocurrency and stock prices through their time series. We will utilize datasets on cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and stocks like NVIDIA to train predictive models that strive to capture patterns in price movements. We hope to gain insights into how machine learning models can be used to predict trends in highly volataile markets and understand the potential of machine learning in a financial application.
